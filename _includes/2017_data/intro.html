                <div>
					<p>
					Translation and interpreting have played and will continue to play important roles in various aspects of UK-China relations and people-to-people exchanges. In addition to the translation and interpreting activities in various forms linking bilateral relations and bridging peoplesâ€™ hearts and minds, the English/Chinese stream has been established and developed in dozens of translation and interpreting programmes in the UK and in over two hundred T&I programmes in China.
Against this background the UK-China Symposium on Translation Studies is designed to be a regular event co-organised by a UK university and a China university in order to promote academic exchanges between UK and China and to stimulate research in Translation Studies with a focus on English/Chinese translation and interpreting as well as their education. 
The 1st UK-China Symposium on Translation Studies will be held on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Centre for Translation Studies in the University of Leeds.
